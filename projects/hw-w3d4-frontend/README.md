# Building A Game in JavaScript

## Directions

For this project, you are going to build a simple game with JavaScript. First, make sure you've [watched this video of Mary Rose Cook building a game from scratch](https://vimeo.com/105955605). Check out [her annotated version of Space Invaders](http://annotated-code.maryrosecook.com/space-invaders/docs/space-invaders.html).

Then play [The Square](http://www.lessmilk.com/game/the-square/). You are going to implement this game yourself using the following steps. You can use external libraries, but nothing that would be considered a game framework. Your game must use JavaScript classes/prototypes and objects.

**ASIDE:** If you are feeling high-speed, you can implement a different game or use different steps.

### Step 1

Create a 500x500 `canvas` tag in your HTML for the game. Create a `Game` class that takes a canvas node and saves it. This class should have a method `draw` that draws a "hollow" (10px white line, no fill) 200x200 square in the middle of the canvas.

This class should also have a method `tick` that calls the `draw` method and uses `requestAnimationFrame` to call `tick` again.

### Step 2

Create a `Player` class. This class should have a method `draw` that draws 
a 40x40 square in the middle of the canvas. The `Game` class's `draw` method should call the `Player` class's `draw` method.

### Step 3

Add movement to the player's rectangle. The rectangle should not be allowed to move outside the containing hollow rectangle.

Create a `Keyboarder` class. You can use the one from [Cook's annotated Space Invaders](http://annotated-code.maryrosecook.com/space-invaders/docs/space-invaders.html). Use your keyboarder to make the player's rectangle move. To do this, you will need to add an `update` method to the `Game` class, and an `update` method to the `Player` class.

### Step 4

Add a coin for the player to gather to the game. This coin, like in the example game, should appear in a random position that is not the player's current position. When the player collects it, it should disappear and reappear elsewhere.

Add a score to the game. The score should go up by one every time the coin is collected.

To do this, you will likely want to create a `Coin` class.

### Step 5

Add hazards to the game. These hazards work like in the example game: flying squares that come from a random edge of the canvas and travel to the opposite edge. They should cross through the outer rectangle that encloses the player. If the player and a hazard collide, reset the score.
